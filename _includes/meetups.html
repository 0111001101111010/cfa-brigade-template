        <p class="lead">View our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Virginia-Beach-VA/">
          Meetups site</a> for our next location and time. We try to meet every few 
          Wednesdays where we hack (develop) our projects,  
          or brainstorm on current issues and activities around Virginia Beach. There's also a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Norfolk-VA/">Norfolk Meetup</a>. It's actually a lot of fun, with great people and usually food/drink.</p>
