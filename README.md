#How to Code for this Repo

Develop/test in your own brance or a feature-named-branch and once it's ready for production, merge from master. Master is linked to the site on Windows Azure and will auto push from github once Azure detects a new commit to master. Careful not to dev in master directly unless it's just spelling/word changes.
